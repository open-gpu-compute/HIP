Kernel Language
===============

This section describes the built-in variables and functions accessible from
the HIP kernel. Itâ€™s intended for readers who are familiar with Cuda kernel
syntax and want to understand how HIP is different.

Features are marked with one of the following keywords:

* Supported---HIP supports the feature with a Cuda-equivalent function
* Not supported---HIP does not support the feature
* Under development---the feature is under development but not yet available
